## **Code Review**
My review contains includes my analysis of all three artifacts, where I examine the existing application functionality, target areas for improvement, and provide a plan to enhance each artifact.

## **Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Development**
  The artifact I chose to enhance for Software Development and Engineering category is a banking application. The application is a calculator that generates an investment 
  report based on user input. The artifact was developed in the C++ programming language. Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was the tool used to develop 
  the application. The application, called Airgead Banking App, was the final project of CS-210 (Programming Languages), which was completed in Winter 2022. 
  
  This artifact was developed at the beginning of my computer science program. I selected this artifact for enhancement to demonstrate my greater understanding of software 
  development and engineering. Specifically, the improved structure, programming logic, and design demonstrate my understanding of the C++ programming language. 
  Adherence to engineering and programming practices by adding input validation and default deny clauses help to ensure that the application operates properly and is 
  more secure. 

  This enhancement aligns with course outcomes which demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques skills, and tools in computing practices for the 
  purposes of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals.
  
  This enhancement also aligns with developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial 
  exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
