## **Code Review**
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
My review contains includes my analysis of all three artifacts, where I examine the existing application functionality, target areas for improvement, and provide a plan to enhance each artifact. Code review is an examination of the projectâ€™s source code, also known as a peer review. My approach involved a thorough evaluation of the code to find errors or opportunities for improvement. A code review is a necessary part of the software best practices because finding errors early in the software development lifecycle process saves time, reduces project costs, and promotes team interaction in a collaborative environment. Reviewing the three selected artifacts helped me apply strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.

## **Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Development**
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
The artifact I chose to enhance for Software Development and Engineering category is a banking application. The application is a calculator that generates an investment report based on user input. The artifact was developed in the C++ programming language. Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was the tool used to develop the application. The application, called Airgead Banking App, was the final project of CS-210 (Programming Languages), which was completed in Winter 2022.

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
This artifact was developed at the beginning of my computer science program. I selected this artifact for enhancement to demonstrate my greater understanding of software development and engineering. Specifically, the improved structure, programming logic, and design will demonstrate my understanding of the C++ programming language. Adherence to engineering and programming practices by adding input validation and default deny clauses will help to ensure that the application operates properly and is more secure.
